# Azure Container Apps Hands-on-Labs

## Overview 
Martha, the CTO of the boutique technology consulting firm - StartUps & More Inc. (SUM Inc.), requires  her consultants to be conversant with emergent technologies & methodologies at a consistent yet fast pace . One of the key decisions she makes with the  advent of every new technology is to determine - it's fit-to-purpose & efficacy before having her consultants delve deeper themselves and consequently having them help their firm's clients.

Azure Container Apps (ACA), the newest offering from Microsoft, providing a serverless platform for running containerized microservices is on the top of Martha's emerging tech list for a few  important reasons that she has heard so far -
1. ACA can empower developers to build cloud-native solutions focusing on their apps rather than cloud infrastructure. 

   *Something that resonated even more - considering startup teams would rather focus on product differentiation, speedy go-to-market as compared to foundational infrastructure setup, security & Day-2 operations.*

2. ACA is built on the foundation of open-source  Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects like - Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) and Distributed Application Runime (Dapr) which are gaining adoption amongst cloud nativedevelopers  & ACA inherently utilizing the CNCF Graduated prooject - Envoy - for its service-proxy functionality.

   *Serverless PaaS powered by CNCF projects to enable developers - sounded like an attractive proposition*

BUT all of this was *still* a surmise ; Martha has looped in and tasked two of her top engineers Alice and Bob to conduct a timeboxed evaluation resulting in key findings based on hand-on evaluation. This time-boxed evaluation has proven to be a stategic advantage to Martha's firm for many years.

Alice is a Kubernetes expert having worked with several of SUM's client on anything ranging from large DIY Kubernetes clusters to vendor managed Kubernets offerings including the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) from Microsoft. She has recently aced the Certified Kubernetes Administrator & Certified Kuberneted Application Developer - exams from the Linux Foundation.

Bob is a polyglot developer - addressing  the full-stack cloud native application development. He is familiar with containerization & orchestration but would rather spend his time building high-performant microservices and applying the needed development rigor driven by well-adopted software development patterns.

Alice and Bob - proceed on the quest set forth by Martha.

## The First Take & next steps

*Alice and Bob - readup on some key documentation, announcements from the Microsoft Product Group and some reference material to utilize as part of the ongoing assessment.*

## Executive summary

*Crisp tabulation of Alice and Bob's findings reported back to Martha before getting the approval to proceed on the hands-on-evaluation and labs*

## The Labs


### Lab 1 – Create an Azure Container Apps service using the Azure Portal.
Utilize the UI to create, understand and see the terminologies (Environments, VNet et.al) in action.

*In Progress*

*1. Screenshots and observations based on Portal. Setting up the stage for further activity , iterartion within  the lab & for the next of labs*


### Lab 2 – Create an ACA service – scripted mode

*Create/ utilize a shell script that enables az cli creation.* 

*In Progress* 

*Running parallel to Lab 1 - extracting the [az cli] commands to achieve everything in Lab 1 in cli-driven manner; makes notes on what can be done only in the portal*

*(Optional) Achieve the same objective as Lab 1 with Bicep. Start lab by Intro and hands-on simple sample of Bicep. *

*To be done*

### Lab 3 – Deploy and test a workload.

*A representative workload (using both UI and backend API)*

*To be done*


### Lab 4 – KEDA in action with Scale to zero

*Introduce KEDA, hands-on sample with AKS (if needed) , then contrast with ACA ease of use and incorporate HTTP handler based scaling down to zero.*
*To be done*

### Lab 5 – Monitoring an ACA app

*Monitoring fundamentals driven by the Log Analytics workspace. Visualize the monitoring with an Azure native option*

*To be done*


### Lab 6 – ACA versioning using [Revisions]

*Exercise introducing multiple iterative changes including app scope changes and enabling audience to learn how Revisions in ACA help with versioning.*

*To be done*
